A simple chess game with (hopefully) some different iterations.

First goal is to get the basis chess game implemented (single player).

Then, move on to being able to add sockets and have another player join the game to play against another.

Then, add in a chess engine to either play as a bot or give move advice. Look at Stockfish for this.
